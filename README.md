# Expenditure

Simple expenditure recording program which uses python and sqlite3.

## What can it do?

Currently it can:
- Input records that contains, purchase date, name, category, cost and need/want.
- Show all recorded data in the sqlite
- Show recorded data based on month and year
- Set auto today to skip the purchase date input

At the moment it just runs on the terminal, will be planning to add on more features and build a simple gui for it.

Feel free to let me know if there's any tips and improvement can be made. Thanks
